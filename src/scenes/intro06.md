This workshop has been inspired by this amazing [article](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iNSQIyNpVGHeak6isbP6AHdHD50gs8MNXF1GCf08efg/pub?embedded=true#h.rncuomopycy0) by [Itay Keren](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/itayke&sa=D&ust=1486676540728000&usg=AFQjCNGkFWB2T-2PaInHS1fRRzTBgCiV1Q) and my own experience writing a handful of 2D engines.

In the future I'll be covering more techniques. If you feel like to contribute, here is the [GitHub](https://github.com/morukutsu/scrolling101) repository for the whole tutorial. All remarks (typos, fixes, improvements) are welcome!
